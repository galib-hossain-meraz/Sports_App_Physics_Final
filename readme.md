## Calculation Results:

- Average speed: 1.6782391458590495 m/s
- Total distance traveled: 215.14092455483328 m
- Total acceleration in x direction: 9603.94380273996 m/s^2
- Total acceleration in y direction: 13128.732843633741 m/s^2
- Total acceleration in z direction: 25602.166787147522 m/s^2
- Number of steps (calculated from z component): 255.5

## Questions:

**Q1:** Does the acceleration calculated from the speed match the observed acceleration? What differences do you notice? What could be their cause?
------- The acceleration calculated from the speed does not match the observed acceleration, the acceleration calculated from the speed does not match the observed acceleration.These are not directly comparable to the average acceleration calculated from average speed. They represent the sum of all the individual accelerations experienced in that direction during the entire motion.

**Q2:** Is the number of steps logical?
------- The number of steps calculated solely from the z-component of acceleration might not be entirely reliable.Z-axis acceleration only captures the vertical component of movement. Steps involve both vertical and horizontal movements, making it difficult to accurately isolate individual steps from this single data point.Faster walking typically involves a smaller vertical displacement compared to slower walking. This can lead to undercounting steps at higher speeds and overcounting at slower speeds.
